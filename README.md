*Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? – a TV quiz simulator*

In order to quickly launch this single-page web app from GitHub:
1. Open https://github.com/pizza5nizza/Millionaire
2. Click on the "<> Code" green button
3. Download ZIP
4. Extract the files
5. Open the "millionaire.html" file in a browser

P.S.:
* The game is a graduation pet-project made on a Front-End course; it's not polished enough and contains some issues
* It's not for commercial use; all its content was found on the Internet and belongs to corresponding rights owners 
* It has only Russian language (Онлайн-игра «Кто хочет стать миллионером?»)
